# 🟠 TRIGGER EVENT TESTS (9 Tests)

These tests verify that the contract's **automatic trigger systems** work correctly.

## 🔥 SwapBack Threshold Trigger Tests

### ✅ Automatic swap trigger on large transaction
- **Scenario**: Large buy transaction of 50,000 CREPE
- **Process**:
  1. Threshold set to 1,000 CREPE
  2. 50,000 CREPE buy transaction executed
  3. 5% tax = 2,500 CREPE accumulates in contract
  4. Since 2,500 > 1,000, SwapBack triggers
- **Result**: ✅ Automatic triggering works

### ✅ Gradual tax accumulation trigger
- **Scenario**: Accumulating tax through small transactions to reach threshold
- **Process**:
  1. Threshold set to 5,000 CREPE
  2. 4 different transactions made (10k, 15k, 20k, 25k CREPE)
  3. Tax accumulates each transaction (500 + 750 + 1000 + 1250 = 3,500 CREPE)
  4. Approaching threshold
- **Result**: ✅ Gradual accumulation correctly tracked

## 🎛️ Manual Swap Trigger Tests

### ✅ Manual swap when tokens exist
- **Scenario**: Owner manually triggers swap when contract has tokens
- **Process**:
  1. Transaction made and 1,000 CREPE accumulates in contract
  2. Owner calls `manualSwapBack()` function
  3. Manual swap triggers
- **Result**: ✅ Manual triggering works

### ✅ Manual swap revert when no tokens
- **Scenario**: Manual swap called when contract has no tokens
- **Expected**: "Cant Swap Back 0 Token!" error
- **Result**: ✅ Error protection works

## 🔄 Pool Detection Trigger Tests

### ✅ Instant trigger on new pool addition
- **Scenario**: Adding new pool at runtime
- **Process**:
  1. Transfer to user3 address → 0% tax (not a pool)
  2. user3 address set as pool
  3. Transfer to user3 address again → 5% tax (now a pool)
- **Result**: ✅ Pool detection triggers instantly

### ✅ Multi-tier pool detection
- **Scenario**: Setting multiple fee tiers for same address
- **Tested fee tiers**: 0.05%, 0.3%, 1%
- **Expected**: Should be recognized as pool for all fee tiers
- **Result**: ✅ Multi-tier detection works
